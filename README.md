## ðŸ‘‹ About me

My name is Marc, I am a student in mathematics & physics, aiming towards a degree in Computer Science.
I started to learn gamedev in 2017, and mostly stopped a year ago to focus on my studies. My main fields are video-games and software development.

## ðŸŒ± Knowledge

  - Unity | C# (since september 2017)
  - Unreal Engine 4 | C++ (during a few months only)
  - Windows Presentation Foundation, .NET | C# (during a few months too)
  - IBM Cplex Studio solver | Optimization Programming Language (during a few months either)
  - Python bot development using Selenium (during a few weeks)
