- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcb152

- 👀 I’m interested in programming & gamedev stuff

- 🌱 My knowledge and experiences:
  - Unity | C# (since september 2017)
  - Unreal Engine 4 | C++ (during a few months only)
  - Windows Presentation Foundation, .NET | C# (during a few months too)
  - IBM Cplex Studio solver | Optimization Programming Language (during a few months either)
  - Python bot development using Selenium (during a few weeks)

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on anything I'm interested in (paid work increases my interest), I love realistic 3d survival games and I've been a huge Minecraft player.
